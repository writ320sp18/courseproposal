## Usability Testing and Documentation Project
*This is a team project.*  

Teams will choose an existing app or program and study its development history. The first part of the project will consist of a detailed report including:
- the history of the product's interface
- timeline of interface changes over time
- an initial application of usability hueristics to the product 

Based on the preliminary findings in this report, teams will:
- design usability testing procedures
- construct and revise supporting documentation
- conduct live usability test 

Finally, they will
- compose an analysis and case study based on the usability test
- issue recommendations regarding the product's interface to an audience of hypothetical developers
- assemble an appendix including
    - team documents, such as the charter and progress reports
    - full documentation of procedures
    - tester consent forms
    - observation notes from the test

Each member of the team will complete a thorough evaluation of their peers.
