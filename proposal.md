### Long Description:

This course aims to prepare students to create technical documents, deploy information to various audiences, and utilize industry-standard platforms for managing knowledge. Students taking this course may come from a variety of academic disciplines and may not want a career explicitly in the field of technical writing. One of the main goals is to provide all students the tools necessary to deliver technical information to specific audiences, regardless of discipline. Student deliverables include technical documentation, usability reports, project proposals, and communication audits in addition to the development of component artifacts for a technical writing portfolio.

## Outcomes
Students will:
1. Foster a sense of writing to multiple audiences for various purposes in real world contexts
2. Create contexts for writing that are real and sophisticated, and that require collaborative action
3. Construct profiles for technical audiences and users of information
4. Collaborate with colleagues to manage dynamic technical document
5. Iterate technical documents at each stage of the development process
6. Deliver products that are precise and free of mechanical errors that inhibit meaning
7. Design content that is universally accessible and adaptable from the concept stage to the execution stage
8. Utilize industry-standard platforms, languages, and tools in the composition process
9. Apply ethics to technical communication scenarios
10. Reflect on the technical communicator's role in the process of knowledge generation

## Deliverables

### Technical Communication Failure Audit
Student will study an approved historical failure of technical communication (Challenger disaster, etc). He/she will prepare a report analyzing failure, highlighting principles of effective technical communication, and will conclude with recommendations to ensure future similar failures in communication would not occur. (Outcomes: 2, 6, 8, 9, 10)

### FOSS Documentation
Student will select an approved FOSS (open-source software) project and develop documentation for an explicit audience use case. This project requires extensive study of the chosen software, an assessment of existing documentation, and a complete profile case study of the identified audience. Student will iterate several drafts of the documentation set and will utilize Git development methodology to release the version-corrected error free documentation set. Student will compose with GitHub-flavored markdown. (Outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8)

### Usability Testing and Documentation (Team Project)
Teams will choose an existing app/software concept and study its development history. The first part of the project will consist of a detailed report on the history of the product interface, how it has evolved over time, and an initial application of usability/UX heuristics. Based on the preliminary findings in this report, teams will design usability testing procedures, construct and revise all supporting documentation, and conduct an actual usability test for their chosen product. Each team will compose an analysis of the usability test and issue recommendations regarding the app/software's UX/UI. This second report will include in its appendix all supporting documentation for the usability test. Team member peer evaluation and assessment will comprise a large percentage of the project grade. (Outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9)

### Technical Writing Portfolio
Student will construct a portfolio using GitHub pages based on a designated repository for technical writing artifacts. In addition to showcasing and curating student development work, the student will also use the portfolio to construct a professional identity with job search materials (resume, etc). Blog posts for the class should also be posted to the portfolio. (Outcomes: 3, 6, 9, 10)

(Note: Students who have already created a portfolio in another platform for WRIT 300 may continue to use it)

### Terms Presentations
Each student will deliver a 10 minute presentation on an approved principle, concept, or term from the field of technical communication. (Outcomes: 2, 3, 6, 7, 10)

### Minor Assignments
### Blogs (to portfolio)
### Too Big to Know Reading Responses
