## Course Description

This course aims to prepare students to create technical documents, deploy information to various audiences, and utilize industry-standard platforms for managing knowledge. Students taking this course may come from a variety of academic disciplines and may not want a career explicitly in the field of technical writing. One of the main goals is to provide all students the tools necessary to deliver technical information to specific audiences, regardless of discipline. Student deliverables include technical documentation, usability reports, project proposals, and communication audits in addition to the development of component artifacts for a technical writing portfolio.

## Learning Outcomes

* Foster a sense of writing to multiple audiences for various purposes in real world contexts
* Create contexts for writing that are real and sophisticated, and that require collaborative action
* Construct profiles for technical audiences and users of information
* Collaborate with colleagues to manage dynamic technical document
* Iterate technical documents at each stage of the development process
* Deliver products that are precise and free of mechanical errors that inhibit meaning
* Design content that is universally accessible and adaptable from the concept stage to the execution stage
* Utilize industry-standard platforms, languages, and tools in the composition process
* Apply ethics to technical communication scenarios
* Reflect on the technical communicator's role in the process of knowledge generation

## Course Logistics

### Communication

WRIT 320 makes use of a variety of communication and collaboration tools. In addition to email, you should use the course's Slack channel to communicate with the instructor and each other. For video chat, I recommend [appear.in](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://appear.in/&sa=D&ust=1496270456620000&usg=AFQjCNHUfmh_RLBUy4RlBXNlf1m-MqDDpA).

### Office Hours

I am generally available online and f2f M-F during regular (Central Time) business hours. Outside of these times, the fastest way to reach me is through Slack or email.

### Attendance Policy

Attendance is mandatory. I make no distinction between excused and unexcused absences. Your participation in daily discussions and group activities is vital to your success in the class. It is your responsibility to keep up with the pace of the course.

### Attendance for Students on Scholarship

If a student is attending UM with a scholarship requiring course absences (e.g, athletics, band), the following exception applies: students will not be penalized for required absences alone, as long as the student presents to the instructor by the end of the course drop/add period an official letter from the scholarship-issuing program declaring the required absences for the entire semester. Students whose scholarship-issuing programs cannot produce such a letter, or determine a schedule in advance, should take the course during another semester. Letters cannot be amended. Students on scholarship who plan to miss 10% of the course should enroll in the course during another semester.

### Standard Withdrawal

The deadline for withdrawal with tuition refund is x/x. The deadline for withdrawal with the possibility of a "W" grade is x/x.

### Hardship Withdrawal

Students suffering traumatic hardships (hospitalization, emergency service, etc.) should promptly consult section VI of the M-Book for procedures on contacting the Dean of Students.

### Special Needs

If you have a documented disability as described by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (P.L. 933-112 Section 504) or the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and would like to request academic and/or physical accommodations, please contact Student Disability Services at 234 Martindale Center, 662-915-7128. Course requirements will not be waived but reasonable accommodations may be provided as appropriate. Please consult [the SDS website](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.olemiss.edu/depts/sds/&sa=D&ust=1496270456627000&usg=AFQjCNFwxEN5oecodvZ8b4JIL2fWD68New) for more information on student disability services.

### Academic Honesty

All work that you submit under your name for credit at UM is assumed to be your original work. While teachers hope and expect for you to incorporate the thinking of others in your work, you must credit others' work when you rely upon it. In your written assignments, there are only three methods for properly importing the work of others: quotation, paraphrase, and summary.

The penalty for plagiarism in Writing 320 may include an "F" on the assignment, an "F" in the course, suspension or expulsion from the university, or other sanctions. Upon determining plagiarism, the instructor will notify the student and the Chair of the Department of Writing and Rhetoric in writing. The instructor will also make a recommendation for the penalty he/she finds most appropriate for the offense. Students may appeal the instructor's finding and/or recommended penalty by notifying the UM Academic Discipline Committee within 14 days of the instructor's decision.

The applicable full UM policy is ACA.AR.600.001 and should be consulted by any student concerned with plagiarism. Broadly speaking, plagiarism is completely avoidable: if you are ever uncertain whether or not you are committing plagiarism, ask your instructor.

### University Writing Centers:

Aside from one-on-one meetings with teachers during office hours, the best way to improve your writing is to work with writing consultants at one of the University's Writing Centers. On the Oxford campus, the writing center is on the 3rd floor of the Lamar building. Writing consultants will work with any student writer working on any project in any discipline. To learn more about Writing Center locations, hours, scheduling and services, please go to [the Writing Centers website](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://rhetoric.olemiss.edu/writing-centers/&sa=D&ust=1496270456630000&usg=AFQjCNF12iQ12m3ABctbO5se_5bQa9JAVg).

Make contact with a Writing Center consultant early and often. Working with a writing consultant is easy, and you have access to face-to-face and online sessions. To make an appointment with a writing consultant, go to [the online scheduler](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://olemiss.mywconline.com/&sa=D&ust=1496270456631000&usg=AFQjCNEjaj6yGEUuYqU_eBnpjkPnYJ5JrQ) and follow the instructions. You may also upload a draft of your paper once you have made the reservation for a session. If you want to see how an online session works, a how-to video is available for students.

Many successful students begin going to the Writing Center with their first essay and continue working with the writing center over the course of a semester, making appointments with writing consultants for each essay they write. The goal of the Writing Center is to help students become better, independent writers, so the writing consultants don't "proofread" or merely "correct" errors. Instead, they do something better – they will help you to brainstorm, talk about research and explore resources, and help you improve your editing strategies. Remember, online appointments are available. If you have questions about the writing center, use the LiveChat tool on our website to talk with someone in the writing center, call us at 662-915-7689, or send email to cwrwc@go.olemiss.edu.

### Library Resources

University Librarians are available to help you find and evaluate sources for your papers. Go to the [library website](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.libraries.olemiss.edu/uml/&sa=D&ust=1496270456634000&usg=AFQjCNHlH_YcIWUS_rdkqfuc2D-nsW8WOw) and click on "Ask A Librarian" for help via live chat, email, and phone. Librarians are available at the Reference Desk on first floor in the Information Commons.

### Grades

A grade of "D" or better is necessary to pass this class.

|  |
| :---: |
| Letter Grade | Equivalency |
| A | 93-100 |
| A- | 90-92 |

### Extensions

I am happy to grant extensions on major assignments  if I receive a written request at least 24 hours in advance of the deadline. I will not consider extensions for non-deliverable assignments or drafts.

### Revise and Resubmit

If you receive a grade lower than 80% on a major assignment, you may revise and resubmit it. You must write a proposal that lists specific aspects of the assignment that you will change (this list must go beyond the feedback you get from me). Revise and resubmit proposals are due 5 business days after you receive a grade on an assignment. You will then have one week (7 days) to complete your revision. The new grade will replace the original grade.
