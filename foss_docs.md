## Free & Open Source Software Documentation Project 
The writer will select an approved free/open-source software project and develop documentation for an explicit use case. This project requires:
- Extensive study of the chosen software
- Assessment of existing documentation
- Audience Profile/User Case Study
- Peer assessment and evaluation report 

The Writer will iterate several drafts of the documentation set and will utilize Git to release version-controlled and error-correct documentation. This documentation should be iterated exlusively in GitHub-flavored Markdown and published using Jekyll to GitHub pages. 

**Course Learning Outcomes**: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8  

### Assignment Outcomes
a. Recognize best-practices of software documentation 
b. Recognize the components of free and open source software
c. Analyze existing documentation
d. Interpret user needs for a specific, designated audience
e. Use Markdown document language to develop documentation 
f. Apply version-control methods to iterate documentation
g. Apply Jekyll to generate static site in GitHub pages for documentation's final iteration 
f. Evaluate peer documentation

### Format Considerations
Documentation must be housed in a separate GitHub repository independent of other work for the course. Choose from one of the approved Jekyll repositories and choose to: 
a. Fork it and compose your documentation in the forked repository   
b. Clone it and compose your documentation locally  
c. Compose documentation locally and build Jekyll site separately, merge upon final iteration  

 ### General Requirement 
 - Overall wordcount should be 1000-1500 words (though this is difficult to measure in this medium)
 - Documentation *must* use sceenshots where appropriate
 - Documentation *must* apply WebAIM standards to ensure overall accessibility of documentation
 - Source repository *must* contain a README file that explains the writer's methods
