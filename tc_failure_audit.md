## Technical Communication Failure Audit
The writer will study an approved historical faulture of technical communication and submit a [problem analysis report](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/olemiss-technicalwriting/chapter/problem-analysis_lecture-2/) that includes the following major sections
- Narrative of the fault or failure
- Discussion of the fault or failure, emphasizing:
    - principles of hueristics of effective technical communication in the appropriate field
    - analysis of specific documents or technical artifacts related to the fault or failure
    - analysis of changes made to the field as a result of the fault or failure
- Recommendations 

**Course Learning Outcomes**: 2, 6, 3, 5, 7, 8

### Assignment Outcomes
1. Identify a historical fault or failure of technical communication  
2. Explain the fault or failure using the discouse of tech comm and in the context of the appropriate field.  
3. Apply heuristics or principles to the fault or failure  
4. Analyze documents and technical artifacts   
5. Critique response to the fault or failure  
6. Recommend specific changes to the field based on the findings of the report

### Format Considerations
The audit report may be submitted in two formats:

1. Formal word-processed document submitted as a Google Doc, PDF, or ODT file. 
2. Markdown-styled digital report pushed to writer's GitHub repo

### Document Requirements
- 1500-2500 words is optimal, but no more than 4000 words
- Images and diagrams as appropriate 
- Five cited credible sources (minimum)
- Multimedia (video, audio) content as appropriate
